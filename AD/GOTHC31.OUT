                          Introduction to Version 3.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for taking an interest in Goth.Code v3.1. To keep up-to-date on new
versions, and their location (as well as where they're mirrored) check
http://www.omen.com.au/~synic/code. The Goth.Code was initially inspired by The
Twink Code and other gay/lesbian/bi signature codes (which in their turn were
inspired by the legendary Hanky Codes). It also uses a few greatly customised
versions of portions of Robert Hayden's Geek Code v2.0.

A significant bug-fix to v3.0 occurred on March 17th 1997 where the Household
Status beginning code prefix "H" had to be altered to "R" (now Residency
status) as "h" (Hawkishness) and "H" (Height) were pre-existing. The more
recent bug-fix to 3.1A on June 27, 1997, saw the sections using the 1-9 scale
having all elements filled in after monumental popular request. It shouldn't
affect any codes or coded results.

Please send me email if you spot things anything like:

  * spelling mistekes ;-),

  * grammatical errors,

  * bugs or conflicting codes,

  * an excuse to praise the author of this code (I could have wasted my time in
    other ways, y'know ;-)),

As always, remember that the letters in this signature code are case-sensitive
(p isn't P). Make sure you add a space when you begin a new section and see the
Eye of Horus goth logo ().

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       How to create and decipher a code using the Goth Code Version 3.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                GLOBAL MODIFIERS

These can be used at any point in your codes, but, should be used sparingly.

  * yyy)xxx( ... I am intent on getting to the status indicated by xxx

  * yyy]xxx[ ... I was once xxx

These should be used only before the identifier's prefix:

  * =Xxxx ... This is cool, huh?

  * ?Xxxx ... I'm really not sure about this code..

  * *Xxxx ... This code changes from day-to-day..

     EXAMPLES: ?A23 means that, although you think you're 23 years old,
     you're not sure, A23]1[ means that you are now 23, but were once aged
     one. (You'd appear twittish if you actually used this example in your
     code, though ;-)), A23)142( means that while you're now 23, you
     specifically want to make it to age 142.. for some reason or other..
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        What's your education Background?

Goths come in many flavours (chocolate, strawberry, er, kidding ;-) ). The
flavours relate to the education and training of the particular gothic in
question.

Begin your code by writing "Go" and then add up to three of the following:

  * Au ... Gothic of Authorship,

  * AS ... Gothic of Applied Sciences (Nursing, Librarianship, etc.),

  * Bi ... Gothic of Biology,

  * Bu ... Gothic of Business/Accountancy,

  * GD ... Gothic of Commercial Arts/Graphic Design,

  * CS ... Gothic of Computer Science,

  * CD ... Gothic of Clothing Design/Production,

  * DJ ... Gothic of DJ'ing (music programming),

  * En ... Gothic of Engineering,

  * Fa ... Gothic of Farming,

  * FA ... Gothic of Fine Arts,

  * Go ... Gothic of Government,

  * HS ... Gothic of High School (use only if you're still there),

  * Hu ... Gothic of Humanities,

  * Ju ... Gothic of Jurisprudence (Law),

  * Ma ... Gothic of Math,

  * MA ... Gothic of Manual Arts (woodwork, metalwork, leatherwork, etc),

  * MD ... Gothic of Medicine,

  * Mu ... Gothic of Music (writing, producing, _not_ DJ'ing),

  * NA ... Gothic of Massage, herbal lore, `new age remedies,' etc.

  * Ph ... Gothic of Philosophy,

  * SB ... Gothic of Small Business,

  * Im ... Gothic of Photography and Image Creation,

  * PS ... Gothic of the Physical Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology etc),

  * Sa ... Gothic of Sales Oriented Stuff (sales assistant, burger flipping,
    telemarketting, etc),

  * Sb ... Gothic of the Sex Industry: BDSM-related,

  * Sp ... Gothic of the Sex Industry: Production of related goods,

  * SS ... Gothic of Social Science (Psychology, Sociology, etc.)

  * Th ... Gothic of Theater (it's so goth to be "GoTh" ;-)),

  * Tr ... Gothic of the Trades (electricians, plumbing, carpentry, etc),

  * TW ... Gothic of Technical Writing

  * ZZ ... Gothic of Other.  Some goths do unusual things for a living..

  * ?? ... Gothic of 'Undecided'. For those who might be changing their
    vocations or have lost their memories.

  * AT ... Gothic of All Trades. For those gothics that can do anything and
    everything. Using GoAT means you don't need to use as many catagories.

  * NQ ... Gothic of No Qualifications.

To the identifier of each one you add, the qualifier:

  * 10 ... I am recognised universally as the eminent person in my field (eg:
    Einstein or Hawking in Physics)

  * 9 ... Postdoctoral degree, such as a DLitt, etc.

  * 8 ... Over qualified to work any job with a Ph.D.

  * 7 ... Honours or a Masters degree grad.

  * 6 ... Managed to finish my bachelors/postgraduate diploma or 3 year
    apprenticeship.

  * 5 ... Learned it the hard way and I'm now an expert.. schools never teach
    you what you -need- to know..

  * 4 ... Finished a short-course (2 years or less)

  * 3 ... Started a degree or short course, and plan to finish it some day.

  * 2 ... Learned it the hard way and I'm now proficient enough to contemplate
    selling my products/services.. I'm planning my future in this field on the
    acquisition of those final skills in order to do it..

  * 1 ... I'm a half-wit when it comes to this.  I really shouldn't be adding
    this to my Goth Code, but, I need something to fill up extra spaces ;-)..

Add a "$" to each catagory in which you hold paid work.

     EXAMPLE: My Bachelors was in Social Sciences and Humanities, I've
     done an applied sciences degree (in Information & Library Studies).
     I'm currently employed in applied sciences, thus my beginning code
     is: GoSS6Hu6AS6$

                              TYPE of Goth "Look"

Add to the "T" prefix up to _three_ of the following:

  * An ... AntiquityGoth: Yep, you're into frills, medieval corsetry and silly
    white shirts and/or dresses.  It's almost the Wuthering Heights look you're
    after (but not like the Kate Bush video clip).

  * Fe ... FetishGoth: rubber, latex, vinyl, PVC.. you name it, hands will
    slide off.. Also included here, I guess, are those who wear clothes that
    are normally unseen for your gender (e.g., pantyhose or dresses for a guy;
    codpieces and muscle-shirts for a woman) * Note: If you are wearing
    corsetry and fishnets, you may have to decide whether or not it looks (on
    you) more like Fetishwear or Antiquity.  It's all a matter of emphasis.

  * P ... GothPunk: Do you have a mohawk?  Big tough leather jacket held
    together with safety pins?  You may fit into this category if people keep
    commenting on why you wear your Dead Kennedys t-shirt while moshing to
    `Temple of Love.'

  * G ... GrungeyGoth: "Kurt Cobain, is that you?"  Well, not quite. Your
    typical grungeygoth may have a fascination for dreadlocks, silly grey
    trenchcoats or appear to lack some sanitary habits.. all quite illusory of
    course ;-).

  * H ... Hippygoth: Lots of colours, a tendency to live in places like
    Fremantle, Western Australia, and Nimbin.. You can tell the hippies because
    they're more than likely to be the ones getting involved with growing their
    own tomatoes (both real and pretend) while wearing the pagan and wiccan
    jewelry..

  * M ... MilitaryGoth: Says Andrew Eldritch, "I think the great lesson of the
    20th century is that you have to separate the ethics from the
    aestetics...The great lesson there is that you don't have to agree with
    what the Nazis did, but, yes, be honest about it, they did have the best
    uniforms. A lot of people can't come to terms with something as banal as
    that."

  * Sk ... SkinGoth: You look like a skinhead or femnazi.. quite a good look
    when done well; just look at Tankgrrl.  The thing that sets this look apart
    from Gothpunk is sheer venom and the look of impending violence.

  * Se ... SecondHandGoth: Not only do you wear second hand clothing (don't we
    _all_?), but, it's obvious that it's second hand.. There's something about
    clothing that you get from the Salvation Army that's just, well, so
    "salvos".. and your clothing style just epitomizes that "look."

  * Jt ... Jeans'n'T-ShirtGoth: Yep.  All you ever wear is your black jeans and
    band t-shirt.  Unfortunately, you may have the tendency to be mistaken for
    a metalhead (they tend to wear black stuff with, well, references to death
    and demons, too), but, it goes with the territory, I suppose.  It's the
    most simple of all looks to arrange and maintain and it works for you.

  * Tg ... TrashyGraveyardGoth: A look that's around in the UK. "We tend to
    wear black ripped things, but quite stylishly" is the description was
    given. Sortof like Punky Brewster lookalikes who only had B&W television to
    model their "look" ;-}..

  * Ad ... AndrogynGoth: The androgynous gothic is distinct from those wearing
    fetishwear by the very fact that they're not really -trying- to produce the
    "phwoaarr!" reaction of their peers.. While the bogans and rednecks may
    wear Wonderbras or stuff their jocks with spare socks, the Androgynous
    gothic is more likely to try to hide their gender.. not by pretending to be
    some other sex, but, by being neither.

  * R ... RockabillyGoth: You look like a rocker in black.  Your critics may
    think, as a result, that you're likely to be slightly braindead, but,
    that's the downside of looking like a greasy redneck who's into Elvis tunes
    played with fiddles and bottle blows ;-).

  * D ... DressupGoth: You dress up to look like characters out of gothic
    novels, movies, etc.  This means, if you're the one who specifically
    dresses to look like Edward Scissorhands, The Crow or Alex from `A
    Clockwork Orange,' then this is your classification.

  * Cy ... CybertechGoth: You wear wires, silicone chips and circuit-boards.
    This makes you itchy as the wiring and boards scrape across your back and
    arms.  However, machines don't feel `Negative Sensations'.. As they say:
    "no brain, no pain" ;-).

  * Gl ... Glittergoth: Tiaras, bizarre 1940s costume wear, silly stuff like
    that. You have no shame when it comes to bringing out the colours and
    flashy stuff.  You're the gothic most likely to incorporate a mirror-ball
    into your wardrobe.

  * Nr ... NewRomantic: Well.. it's a style that so close to gothic, it may as
    well be included.  It's been argued before in alt.gothic that gothic is
    simply a subgenre of the new romantic period, and artists like Adam Ant
    just go to prove it. Dressing in the style of early Madonna/Siouxsie, Split
    Enz, and the like may seem a bit bright on the eyes to your peers, but, you
    and your trusty false sword are ready for 'em ;-).

  * Sp ... SpaghettiWestern: has cowboy boots with spider webs and skulls on
    it. It's the whole Near Dark, Dark Western, American Gothic thing. Think of
    the Fields of the Nephilim t-shirt, add a touch of Jack Palance and Edward
    Scissorhands, and you've probably got it in one.

  * In ... IndustrialGoth: This section is for try-hards who absolutely _have_
    to let everyone know that they like Industrial music. They cannot cope with
    the idea that they're Jeans'n'T-shirtGoths who just wear t-shirts with
    Industrial bands on them.  This catagory is included on sufferance _only_
    because I received something like 15 comments all asking for it. Here it
    is, lads. Wallow.

  * Y ... I don't look at all gothic. (Add to the "Y" you've just written down,
    one of the following:)

    * bo ... Bogan: "Where's the beer! Fuck, someone's stealin' me Commodore!!
      Who's that f*ckin' sheila think she f*ckin' think she is?! C'arn the
      Eagles, mayte! Metallica f*ckin' rools!" An Australian phenomenon that we
      hope doesn't get exported ;-).

    * re ... Redneck: Wears overalls and is known to be.. well, a bit thick.
      Think of Boss Hogg (or any of them, really) from "The Dukes of Hazzard"
      and you've got the right stereotype.

    * yu ... YUPPie: Originally, the abbreviation stood for "Young Urban
      Professional People," but these days the stereotype is a cafe-visiting
      wanker in a suit.

    * rv ... Raver: has the classic baggy wide-bottomed trousers said to be
      worn to let heat dissipate during raves (you may or may not know why
      ;-)),

    * pu ... Punk: has the torn trousers and grotty jacket (because they "don't
      care 'bout nuffink"). Imagine a goth with more colour, less education and
      lower hygiene standards.

    * cs ... Corporate Slave: Wears a suit and tie to work, and is just that
      bit more conservative a look than your average punk.

    * sd ... Z3RF1/\/ |)00|) \/\/|-|[] |_|z3z |)/\F+ /\S(|| (|-|/\R/\(+3RZ +[]
      \/\/R1+3 []/\/ +|-|3 '/\/3+ (Translation: a surfie whose name is B1FF).

    * in ... Indy Kid: Colourful but comfortable clothing that's more practical
      than particularly fashionable. They're often seen with band t-shirts, so
      they're easy to identify ;-).

    * gr ... Grungey: Just like Indy Kids except they don't wash. At all.

    * hi ... Hippy: Much like the Indie Kid, except the colours are that much
      more vibrant and they carry a spirituality, practicality,
      environmentalist and optimistic message into their lives and dress style.

    * dm ... Death metaller: wears t-shirts with skulls and demonic stuff on
      them because they think that "evil" is "Hard-Core."

    * ra ... Gangsta Rapper: "Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!" They seem to like the yoyo craze
      a lot.

    * rb ... Rockabilly: slicked-back hair and equally polished leatherwear.
      They're most often seen at Elvis Look-alike competitions.

    * mo ... Mod: Beware their motor scooters of death! They dress smartly but
      wear a Speed addict pose.

    * gc ... Zitty-faced Geek Code Users: Looking like high school maths
      teachers, these lads are most known for plain button-up shirts,
      pocket-protectors, tight knee-length shorts, and a giddy grin at anybody
      who actually smiles their way.

    * bt ... Bad Taste Kid: Much like the Geeks, BTKs wear daggy stuff. But,
      BTKs wear their stuff to shock and carry the attitude of a geek who's
      been pressed that bit too far!

    * sk ... Skinhead: Er, I don't think I'll describe these guys in a sarky
      way ;-). The look emerged from the construction sites of Britain, with a
      lot of British nationalism. That should give you a hint.

    * mf ... Mother/Father: Parents of teenagers have this sortof slack
      conservative look. I guess it comes with the poverty and stress of having
      had to pay for and live with brats like you and I.

    * zz ... Something not goth, so amazingly bizarre and goddamned weird, but,
      also not on this list of non-goth appearance types.

  * Z ... You look goth, but, so amazingly bizarre and goddamned weird that
    your style can not be classified from amongst this list.

Put any secondary looks that you are also to be seen out in Try to keep a
maximum of three.  Use _no_ commas, brackets or spaces between them.

     EXAMPLE: Billy is mostly seen looking gothpunk, he also goes out
     sometimes looking fairly fetishy.. and occasionally he'll just be a
     bit grungey if he's feeling decrepit, aged and depressed. So, his
     code here would be: TPFeG
     EXAMPLE: Someone who was writing to this group, who is forced by
     their boss or preference to wear a suit and tie to their work, but
     wears fetishwear out to clubs, and occasionally wears raver clothes
     when going out to gay nightclubs would be: TYyuFeYrv

Finally, estimate the percentage of your awake hours that you're dressed in a
way that -might- be considered goth by some. (Yes, that includes the hour
you're in the shower and the 15 minutes you're in your pyjamas having
breakfast!) Now divide that number by ten (10) and round it to the nearest
whole number. Add this at the end of your code.
     EXAMPLES: TPFeG5, TYrvYskTbt1, TGYsePu5

                                Your PERSONALITY

Add to the "P" prefix up to _three_ of the following.  As with the Appearance
Types, list them with your most prominent one appearing first:

  * 0 ... I have no personality (do not use with any other personality types.)

  * Mo ... MopeyGoth: Life is a permanent existential crisis, while you're
    getting together whether or not you feel worse about the escalating
    conflicts in foreign lands, the fate of the world's starving and the
    futility of the United Nations, or your own personal tragedies.. it's _all_
    so awful, and no-one knows it more than you do.

  * Pe ... PerkyGoff: "I don't care if you're feeling depressed, whether or not
    it's `in style' to be morbid, or what.. I'm going to get onto that dance
    floor and jiggle myself so that I look like a duck!"

  * Na ... NarkyGoth: You're an angry young (wo)man!  You've got a
    political/philosophical/religious/ideological cause, and you're not afraid
    to to let people know, deconstructed and reconstructed into logical formed
    argument until your brain seems to be melting and dribbling out your ears.

  * Sa ... SarkyGoth: Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.. yep, you've seen it
    all and experienced it and have a chip on your shoulder that weighs three
    tonnes.  Your reaction to the weight of your experience has not been to
    blubber at it, and be depressed, but to attack it with all the flaming
    venom you can maintain.

  * St ... StrutterGoth: Go with the fashion, be where it's at!  People who
    hate you might think of you as a poser, but, that's only because they're
    jealous.  Being seen and _known_ is an important thing to you, since it's
    the popular ones who get the girls/boys and make it to become heads of
    state and run the game.

  * L ... LazyGoth: Stress is something that you prefer to avoid.. it reduces
    your life span, reduces your quality of life and makes you lose out on
    sleep.

  * Sl ... CorporateSlaveGoth: Unlike the LazyGoth, you survive on stress; it's
    your life's blood.  You're a working goth who actually _loves_ your job and
    enjoys the comforts that your job brings. People who like songs like SNOG's
    `Corporate Slave' irritate you just a bit.. don't they realise that
    someone's got to work to keep the country afloat?

  * Pr ... PerfectionistGoth: You need things to be just right.  Otherwise,
    there'll be all hell to pay.  People who don't like you sometimes call you
    `anally retentive,' but, all those itty bitty things out of place add up to
    huge problems!!

  * Sh ... ShyGoth: "Please don't look at me.. oh, please.." *scuttles to the
    corner of the club* "I wish they wouldn't try to talk to me.." *pouts*  A
    shygoth is, unfortunately, well, dreadfully shy when it comes to conversing
    with other new goths that they might encounter. Later, when they've become
    more comfortable, they may come out of their shells.. but, until then..

  * Sg ... SlutGoth: You're your state/territory's own Don Juan/May West: God's
    gift to wo/men.. This isn't just your own opinion, either. You rarely are
    single for longer than a week, but, are rarely involved in a relationship
    for longer than a month.  This may or may not be intentional on your part,
    however, the important bit is that you have no problems attracting fresh
    blood.

  * Do ... DopeyGoth: This isn't to say that you've got a poor attention span,
    are dumb or not always "with it" (although these _may_ apply ;-) ).  Some
    people like to sit and talk philosophy with friends all night; you're not
    one of them. You're the type who's more likely to just enjoy the chance to
    veg with the television on Channel Ten or do something that doesn't tax
    your mind (like get stoned and play Multiplayer Quake all night).

  * G ... GeekyGoth: You play roleplaying games, wear a calulator in your
    pocket and have big chunky coke-bottle glasses.  Friends may see you as `an
    individual' who can be creative amongst your geeky friends.. The upshot is
    you don't have any enemies (because well, you're kinda socially
    insignificant ;-) ).

  * De ... DefeatistGoth: "The whole world's against me.  I can't get a
    boy/girlfriend.. can't get a job.. I wish those bloody bells would stop..
    why is it always _me_!"  While you share the sarkygoth's chip on the
    shoulder, your prefered way of coping is by moping around and blaming
    yourself and everyone around you..

  * E ... EnnuiGoth: You're usually bored.  Really bored.  Really really bored.
    Really really really bored.  Really really really really bored. Really
    really really really really bored..

  * R ... RomanticGoth: You live your life in an epitome of the gothic romance;
    like Morticia and Gomez Addams, you cannot live your life any other way
    because life would be so damned shallow and _empty_.

  * Pa ... PanicGoth: Life is a continuous panic situation that you're never
    quite prepared for.. Hey, you've seen enough 1980s BBC comedies to know
    what I mean..

  * Dr ... DramaQueen: Everything is always better or worse for _you_,
    something which you take note of all the time.. much to your friends
    chagrin.

  * Ni ... NihilisGoth: You're a nihilist.  You don't care about anything or
    anyone.  People hate you, and you don't care.. the world's environment is
    dying and it doesn't matter.. you're an apathetic git, whose most likely
    response to an advert from the Save-the-Starving-Walrus Fund is, "Any of
    that fresh baby turtle soup left, ckickybabe?"

  * Sc ... SchemerGoth: "I have a cunning plan.."  You've seen Blackadder, so
    you've got an idea.. your impersonation of Rowan Atkinson in the title role
    is peckable.  (Note: If you're a "scheming bitch," you might want to work
    out which is more dominant: Sarky or Schemer.. and then attribute
    accordingly)

  * ! ... You cannot and will not be classified according to any of the above.
    You are much too complex and noble a creature to allow yourself to be
    pidgeonholed this way *wank*toss*wank* ;-) and "I will not be stamped,
    indexed, filed or numbered!" is your favourite sample from `The Prisoner.'

If you're a many-sided creature, then it's fine and dandy to list your two to
three most dominant sides, in the same form that you did for your Appearance
Type.  Don't use commas to separate them; the case of the characters indicates
where one begins and the other ends.. using commas wastes space ;-).

                          The BOOTS you most often wear

Okay, we could have codes that are paragraphs long if we included _all_ of our
boots, so here we are going to only catalog our _favourite_ pair. Firstly,
count the number of holes it has (on only _one_ side, you at the back!).  Write
this down using the "B" identifier.

Add a "/" and then the aproximate height of your boots in cms (an inch is 2.54
centimetres, for the decimally challenged) and measure from the sole to the top
(ie, don't include the heel).

Now, add to this, this colour chart:

  * Bk ... Black

  * LTa ... Light tan

  * LBr ... Light brown

  * Br ... Brown

  * DBr ... Dark Brown

  * R ... Red

  * B ... Blue

  * G ... Green

  * C ... Orange

  * Y ... Yellow

  * Gr ... Grey

  * Z ... Other colour not on this list

Now add the following, as appropriate:

  * ! ... They have steel or strengthened caps for safety and/or intimidating
    people

  * * ... They have studs

  * + ... They have rocket-studs

  * \ ... They have pointed toes

  * ]2, ]6, etc ... They have 2 or 6, etc buckles

  * "2, "6, etc ... They have 2" or 6", etc heels (round to the nearest inch)

  * z2, z6, etc ... They have 2 or 6 zips on them

  * @ ... I don't do up the laces!

EXAMPLE #1: my most worn pair of boots, being my Australian Army General
Purpose Boots, the code here would be: B11/21BK!"1@
EXAMPLE #2: Helen's boots don't have any lace holes at all. They're tall boots
with a zip that goes right the way up to the top.  Therefore, Helen's boot code
is: B/39Bk"3z1

                             Hair COLOUR and Length

Goths come in all sorts of hair colours, some natural and some `assisted.' In
this section, we catagorise your hair colour and length.. Firstly, add a "c".
The next part deals with colour.  Any multiple colourings should be dealt with
as for Personality & Appearance types (ie, choose up to three..

  * Bk ... Black

  * Wb ... White blonde

  * Lb ... Light blonde

  * B ... Blonde

  * Lbr ... Light brown

  * Br ... Brown

  * Dbr ... Dark Brown

  * Sb ... Strawberry blonde

  * Nr ... Natural Red

  * Bu ... Blue

  * G ... Green

  * O ... Orange

  * R ... Red (like a fire fighters truck)

  * Gr ... Grey

  * P ... Purple

  * Pi ... Pink

  * Z ... Other colour not on the list

If your colour is an `assisted' one, place your natural colour (if you don't
mind people knowing it) in round brackets after this.. eg, cLbrSb(Bk).. If your
colour is changing of its own accord, then use parentheses with the most
predominant colour first. eg, cBk{Wb}..

Add a dash (-).

Now, add one modifier to the list which describes best what your hair is doing
at the moment:

  * b ... bald

  * s ... un/styled; straight

  * w ... un/styled; wavy

  * c ... un/styled; curly

  * m ... in a mohawk

  * q ... quiff

  * f ... flat-top

  * u ... usually "up" and with enough spray to gel together the panels of the
    Sydney Opera House, much like Patricia Morrison

  * W ... I wear an assortment of wigs

  * e ... I use hair extensions.

  * d ... Dreadlocks,

  * k ... Crimped,

  * p ... ponytail,

  * P ... Pigtails,

  * Y ... some other style

  * Z ... no style for some other reason.

Add to this the following, to define how long your hair is (measuring the back)

  * 1 ... Bald or a "Number One, Two or Three" shave,

  * 2 ... Short cropped,

  * 3 ... Average "short-back-and-sides" job,

  * 4 ... At about chin-length..

  * 5 ... Somewhere in between

  * 6 ... At that irritating length where the front gets in your eyes and the
    back looks particularly dickie in the centre of your neck,

  * 7 ... Shoulder-length,

  * 8 ... Down to the centre of your back,

  * 9 ... Down to your bum,

Add to this, any of the following facial hair characteristics as required:

  * B ... Beard

  * G ... Goatee,

  * M ... Moustache,

  * S ... Stubble,

  * L ... Strange bit of bum-fluff that you get just above your beard, below
    your lower lip.

     EXAMPLES: cDbr-w6, cLbrSb(Bk)-d7

                             VULGARITY/Savior faire

After writing "V" add one of the following:

  * 9 ... I am a regular writer to alt.tasteless and am documented on their
    "Who's Who on a.t." regular posting..

  * 8 ... I excel at grossing people out, both in speech and in actions.

  * 7 ... I'm known by my peers for being a bit vulgar and base sometimes.

  * 6 ... Er, my sense of humour can sometimes be a bit on the dubious side..

  * 2 ... I regularly read Miss Manners on etiquette and/or have done a
    deportment course.

  * 1 ... I have written articles on etiquette and/or I _run_ a deportment
    course..

Add to this one of the following (only if appropriate):

  * s ... My vulgarity/savior fare rating can swerve to fit the occasion; the
    code listed before this suffix just refers to my "native" vulgarity ;-).

  * S ... My vulgarity/good manners rating swerves to be at odds with what a
    situation calls for.

EXAMPLES: V6s, V9S

                          How much do you like MUSIC?

Before you do anything: Write down an "M" for this Music section and then
choose which of the following describes how much you like it.

  * 1 ... Is there anything at all else to buy??? I can name the artists, and
    give you a discography at will.

  * 2 ... I have the largest music collection out of everyone I know, and can
    name all the artists.

  * 3 ... I have a pretty decent CD/record/cassette collection.

  * 5 ... I like it.. but not much more than I like taking a leak in the loo.
    It just happens, okay?

  * 6 ... I can't make the time to sit around listening to music.

  * 7 ... I really don't like it.

  * 8 ... I'd rather wash my dog's testicles than listen to music.

  * 9 ... I'd rather give my horse a six hour rimjob than listen to music,
    thankyouverymuch!

Add to this any of the following which are appropriate:

  * p1, p3, etc ... I play one, three, etc, musical instruments.

  * w ... I write my own music.

  * g ... I sometimes do gigs/performances.

And (if applicable) only _one_ of the following:

    recording.

  * S ... I have had my music professionally mixed and produced and have sold
    copies via local shops or gigs.

  * R ... I am signed to a major recording studio/distribution network.

     EXAMPLE: Because I enjoy music and write my own stuff (and sequence
     it using my DOSbox and a Yamaha PSR400 keyboard), I'd write this code
     down for myself as: M4p1wD

                      "CYBERPUNKINESS"/Technology Aptitude

After writing "C", choose one which best describes your aptitudes:

  * 9 ... I often hack to find out, or kludge my way through, information about
    how to make ordinary programs, gadgets and household objects do things well
    beyond their intended use or specifications

  * 8 ... I live for new technology; I am the master at RTFM and can make sense
    of the newest of the new and the oldest of the old with ease.

  * 7 ... My friends call me to trouble-shoot their computer problems
    sometimes.

  * 6 ... I can quickly learn how to operate equipment and software in my field
    of expertise.

  * 5 ... It can take a little time, but, I can work out these new fangled
    gadgets and sorta enjoy it.. kinda.

  * 4 ... I don't like using my microwave oven.

  * 3 ... I read wristwatch manuals to make sure I understand.

  * 2 ... I had to read the manual six times to work out how to use my

    dang blasted thing.

Add one or more of the following modifiers:

    nuts, bolts, car or truck engines, etc)

    involve integrated circuits, diodes, transistors, restistors, etc)

  * p ... I am chemical-properties minded (ie, you can mix compounds to produce
    stuff; often found with chemists, pyrotechnicians, etc)

                                What AGE are you?

Write your age in years after the "a" prefix.  And don't lie ;-). Add to this,
one of the modifiers:

  * + ... I'm told I look older than that!

  * = ... I'm told that I look this age, too.

  * - ... I'm told I look younger than this!

     EXAMPLE: a23-, a100=, a16+

As an alternative to the above, add the age which _most_ people think you are
(and you must have been told this specifically by at least five people).
     EXAMPLE: Something like three ex-girlfriends and innumerable others
     still reckon that I look 19.  Therefore, my code would be: a24(19)

                          NUTRITION and eating habits

Goths _usually_ consume food. Some eat everything they can grab while some
others are quite conscious of their food.  It's all a part of that myriad of
experiences of being a goth in the 90s; you can usually get a picture of the
person by what they eat..

Write "n" and then add _one_ of the following which most closely matches you:

  * 9 ... I keep myself on a strict diet..

  * 8 ... I try to keep healthy at all times!

  * 7 ... I always prefer to go for the healthy food, but, occasionally I'll
    eat some crap..

  * 6 ... I sometimes go for the healthy stuff.

  * 5 ... Eh what? never mind the menu, just gimme something to eat!

  * 4 ... Food? I just grab something from the shelves with meat in it.

  * 3 ... I eat only the cheap things - even with artificial meat and
    vegetables.

  * 2 ... I eat only eat animal flesh.

  * 1 ... I live on potato chips and Jolt Cola.

  * v ... I'm a vampire and I only drink -blood-. (*sigh*).

  * a ... I prefer to use amphetamines like Speed and other illicit drugs to
    avoid silly things like eating.

Add any of the following which may apply to you:

  * V ... I am a strict vegetarian,

  * P ... I do not eat meat or animal products

  * D ... My nutritional needs are determined by my body's intolerances.

  * A ... I am allergic to almost all knowntional habits are such because I am
    on doctors orders or because I have massive allergies.

  * F ... Although it doesn't affect the -quality- of my eating habits, as
    listed above, I usually live on Takeaways (not the band featured in the
    silly ABC-TV series "Sweet and Sour' that had James Reyne and Tracey Mann
    in it ;-)).

  * M ... Although it doesn't affect the -quality- of my eating habits, as
    listed above, I make all my food.. I cook it all by myself.

                                Body shape/BUILD

Goths come in many shapes and sizes.  Build code is divided into two parts.
But, before we do anything, write down a "b".

Firstly, how fit/healthy are you?

  * 9 ... Very very muscley.

  * 8 ... "Lets get physical, physical.."

  * 7 ... Mostly toned.

  * 6 ... I'm a little fitter than average.

  * 5 ... Average. The heart association say so.

  * 4 ... I lose my breath, dancing.

  * 3 ... I lose my breath picking up the mail.

  * 2 ... I can't get up the stairs without running out of puff.

  * 1 ... I can't even get out of bed.

And now, how chubby are you? (note: you should -not- add a ":" character
between these two.  You should end up with a double-digit number after the "b")

  * 9 ... I'm "bloody huge".

  * 8 ... I'm quite, er, plump.

  * 7 ... I'm rounder than most.

  * 6 ... I'm little rounder than most.

  * 5 ... I'm an average goth.

  * 4 ... Everyone tells me to gain a few pounds.

  * 3 ... Modelling agencies are starting to get interested in me.

  * 2 ... People think I might be anorexic.

  * 1 ... People think I'm from a World Vision ad.

Add to this any of the following that may be appropriate:

  * T ... I am in sports training,

  * D ... I am on a diet,

  * H ... I am in a hospital,

  * X ... I have Complete Body Dysfunction (CBD).

  * M ... I have an extreme or unusually masculine shape for my gender.

  * F ... I have an extreme or unusually feminine shape for my gender.

     EXAMPLE: Jane Doe is about average in terms of flesh tone and
     fitness, but, everyone thinks she's a little underweight and says she
     should put on a little bit.. Under this identifier, she'd be: b54

                                     HEIGHT

Write your height with the H prefix.  In contrast to The Goth Code v1.x, we're
going to calculate your height in centimetres only.  Feet and inches is no
longer acceptable.

There are 12 inches to the foot.  There are 2.54 cm per inch.

     EXAMPLE: Since I'm 5'8", my first calculation is (5 feet x 12 inches)
     + 8 inches = 68 inches.  68 inches x 2.54 = 172.72 cms. Rounding this
     to the nearest integer, my height is: 173 cm.  In this example, my
     resulting code is: H173

                  Pretentiousness (are you GOTHIER-THAN-THOU?)

Pretentiousness has always been a part of being goth.  Whether you're
pretentiously AntiquityGoth ("I outstyle him/her by miles") or pretentiously
SkinGoth ("I can beat the shit out of him/her without trying, if I need to"),
now's the time to fess up to your perceived social status.

Write down a "g" and choose one of the following which best suits you:

  * 9 ... I am so gothic that I don't even need to speak to communicate volumes
    and keep them enthralled at my feet..

  * 8 ... I usually _lead_ conversation at a purely goth party.

  * 7 ... Pretty goth.. I can usually make very good conversation at a purely
    goth party.

  * 6 ... I know what's what and where enough to look like I know my stuff.

  * 5 ... Er, I'm a goth, alright..

  * 4 ... I'm an interested newbie who's just started looking into the scene.

  * 3 ... I'm make obvious errors in judgement about what to wear and/or say.

  * 2 ... People cringe when I open my mouth or enter the room.

  * 1 ... I have been banned from nightclubs because I lack basic social
    graces.

Add to this _one_ of the following suffixes:

"People judge me the most by the way I...

  * L ... Look"

  * A ... Act"

  * T ... The ideas I come up with and the way I think"

  * S ... Smell"

  * F ... Feel (touching me conveys the impression I'm a goth; strange, yet
    true.)"

  * ! ... Am.. Everything conveys the same image."

Now, add a four digit code where:

  * the first two digits indicate the month you got into the goth scene (use
    "??" if you're not sure),

  * the second two digits indicate the year you got into the scene (feel free
    to use a "?" for part of the year code if you're not sure)

     EXAMPLES SO FAR: James doesn't consider himself gothic at all, so his
     code might be: g3!???? .. Kayos got into goth sometime in the 1970s
     ("before anyone else did, y'see") and so his code might be g9L??7? ..
     Kim Beasley got into the scene in August 1997, and is a bit of a
     perky newbie, so his code might be: g4L0897
Okay, add to this one of the following that applies to you: "I got into the
goth scene through..

  * F ... Friends in another scene who were also into goth (add the "non-goth
    appearance code" of the other scene: eg, FYbo, FYbt)

  * M ... The media convincing me it was a cool place to be

  * I ... The internet convincing me it was a cool place to be

  * A ... Somehow my general inherent angsty persona seemed to draw me into it
    as soon as I saw it

     EXAMPLES: g3!????M, g9L???7?I, g4L0197FYbo

                       How you do your MAKEUP and bodyart

In this section, we're going to code how you do your makeup and what bits
you've got pierced for decoration.  Add to the "m" qualifier the following and
add the number of piercings before each consecutive new pierce type:

  * Ea ... Ears

  * Na ... Navel

  * Ni ... Nipples

  * No ... Nose

  * Li ... Lips

  * G ... Genital area

  * Ey ... Eyebrows

  * H ... Hands

  * T ... Tongue

  * Z ... Other

EXAMPLE: So, at this stage, someone who has six pierces in their ears and has
both nipples pierced will be coded as: mEa6Ni2

Add which of the following best describes you:

  * @S ... I have tatoos that cover a small portion of my body.

  * @M ... I have tatoos that cover a medium portion of my body.

  * @L ... I have tatoos that cover a large portion of my body.

  * @T ... My makeup is tattooed and would take laser surgery to remove.

  * @Z ... I have zero tattoos. None at all.

Then, add which of the following applies to you the most:

  * 9 ... I wear makeup all over my body; no body part escapes the process of
    beautification; I spend 12 hours out of my 17 hours awake just getting it
    _right_..

  * 8 ... I spend every moment checking that my makeup hasn't fallen out of
    place.  This makes me quite unapproachable because my gaze is always into
    my compact and my attention is on my single zit and its colouration in
    comparison with the surrounding skin tones.

  * 7 ... I spend half my time at nightclubs giving my makeup touch-up jobs..

  * 6 ... I wear makeup all of the time and I take care to ensure I look good.

  * 5 ... I wear makeup most of the time, but, only to cover up the cracks
    and/or acne.

  * 4 ... I only make an effort at parties and nightclub outings if they're
    special occasions.

  * 3 ... I don't wear makeup.

  * 2 ... If I find people wearing makeup, I get angry at them for being so
    insensitive to ignore the starving people in third world countries who can
    barely afford to feed themselves.

  * 1 ... If I find people wearing makeup, I get angry enough to slice open
    their chest and gouge my hands into their entrails and play with them for a
    while before slicing away their respiratory system.

Add to the result of this, any of these qualifiers where appropriate:

  * A ... I am allergic to almost all known beauty products.

  * # ... The only colours I use are Black and White.

  * ? ... I really don't know how to do my makeup properly, though you probably
    could guess that ;-).

  * & ... I get someone else to do my makeup for me

  * $ ... I am in the beauty products/services industry.

  * $$ ... I single-handedly support the beauty products/services industry.

                      How WEIRD you seem to the "normals"

Goths have a seemingly natural knack for being "weird".  As a general rule, the
following weird qualifiers allow a goth to rate their weirdness, and how much
they're actually -noticed- as being weird and how often they scare small
children.

Add a "w" and then choose one:

  * 9 ... People walk past lepers dancing on Barney Dinosaur costumes when they
    see me just doing my shopping..

  * 8 ... I make Rob Smith (of The Cure) and Lux Interior (of The Cramps) look
    a bit humdrum.

  * 7 ... I'm a bit wierder than most other goths I know.

  * 6 ... So?  what's your problem with weird.

  * 5 ... I'm not weird.  I blend in perfectly.. no one would guess..
    (muahahahahaha!)

  * 4 ... I'm more normal that most people normally are.

  * 3 ... I am so incredibly boring it's tedious to explain..

  * 2 ... I construct signature codes because I think they're cool ;-).

  * 1 ... My name is John Howard and I am the Leader of the Liberal Party of
    Australia.

Then add to your code the following:

People think that the wierdest aspect to me is the way I...

  * L ... Look: There's something about the way I appear that seems, well,
    strange to people.

  * A ... Act: Some of the things that I do seem to freak people out,
    sometimes.

  * T ... Think: Some of the things that I say can appear really bizarre and
    wierd to people I meet; I squick people often.

  * S ... Smell: I smell like formaldahyde, or something quite bizarre.

  * F ... Feel: When people touch me, my flesh sends strange signals to the
    toucher's sensory perceptors that says, "hey, this person is -wierd-."

  * ! ... Am: Everything about me conveys the same message..

                                    VAMPIRES?

The whole notion that Vampires have -anything- to do with the gothic subculture
really is not a new thing. Bands like Bauhaus and The Cure paved the way with
such songs and clips as "Bela Lugosi's Dead" and "Charlotte Sometimes" there's
the link between gothic horror and mediaeval buildings and fashions. What -is-
new is that there are a few trying to emulate the horror in real life by
dressing up as, or claiming to be, vampires. Whether or not they're serious

                            RELIGIOUS or Atheistic?

    or some other soul rebirthing system,

    world (eg, the Sun, Moon, planets, Bill Gates, The Great Tortoise that
    created the Universe by sneezing it out of its magic nostril, etc).

  * p ... I think pagans will go to Hell for their sins for not recognising the
    One & True God (whoever I might think that is).

If you responded between 1 and 3 to the above, you might like to add "ZZZZZz"
and skip to the next section. Otherwise, choose one of the following which best
describes your feelings on nationalisation:

  * 9 ... All corporate assets should be nationalised in the hands of a
    government which knows how best to allocate resources.

    should be allowed to flourish.

    public infrastructure as well as the sound management of the economy to
    ensure another 1929 or 1989 never again occurs.

    maintain standards on what businesses may and may not produce.

    restless."

  * 1 ... Adam Smith's Invisible Hand allocates resources best on the basis of

    people not to interfere with economic cycles. Business must be totally free

and censorship:

  * 9 ... Governments ought to ensure that people experience the most that

    "Un-American" should be as far away from gaining power as possible, even if

  * 2 ... "Un-Americanism" shouldn't be tolerated by non-American nations (the
    US policy on the United Nations back in the 1950s).

  * 1 ... Governments must act with violent action to ensure The One True Way
    is enforced!

    person's gender should -never- come into decisions on everyday life.

  * 4 ... I encourage men to do their best.

  * 3 ... I'm in favour of encouraging men to do their best to excell with
    social programmes to redress the balance..

  * 2 ... I'm in favour of helping men to do their best to excell with social
    programmes to redress the balance..

  * 1 ... I am in favour of "negative" discrimination to ensure men get the
    best jobs

  * Z ... Doesn't matter to me..

Choose out of the following whichever describes your opinion on which is
required the most to provide the better political system:

  * Ed ... Enforced Democracy: Everyone is forced to vote, but, there is a
    "none of the above" provision and entirely free elections.

  * Rd ... Representational Democracy: Parties are represented in government by
    number according to the percentages which they polled at election time.

  * Fp ... First-past-the-post Democracy: The party with the most votes gets
    all the power to do what it wants.

  * Me ... Meritocracy: To be able to vote, you need to have skills or enough
    education to be able to make an "informed" decision.

  * Dc ... Democratic Centralism: Issues decided once and agreed upon must be
    executed with the least amount of debate at lower levels.

  * Hm ... Heirarchy Model: Heirarchy based on communitarian/business lines.
    Leadership is arbitrarily taken away or given on the basis of merit, skill
    and negotiation within the heirarchy.

  * Pb ... Pocket Burroughs: Votes should be allocated according to the
    economic productivity of the citizen.

  * Zz ... Why worry about the finer points? A politician always wins..

                        On DRUGS, both legal and illegal

Now, catagorise your opinion with regard to taking illegal mind/mood altering
drugs according to one of the following:

                       When Single (gothic `HAWKISHNESS')

Many people find solace with those of like minds and attitudes. Just like other
small communities such as religious groups and the gay crowd, many people are
more likely to look for their next partner from amongst those in their local
scene. Add a "h" then choose one of the following:

"When single I like to..

  * 9 ... search out other goths whenever at all possible."

  * 8 ... search for goths amongst the crowds."

h5 or above people should work out what it is that -initially- attracts them to
new partners.  Add the Personality Type -or- the Appearance Type section of
your desired guy/girl in curly-brackets.
     EXAMPLES: h6(TPeGMo) or h5(P!GPu)

                Your SEXUALITY and preferred type of Relationship

The Goth scene, like no other, is geared towards the plurality of relationship
types.. whether they're open or closed.  But, openness with regard to your
desires to your partners or prospective partners is always something to be
encouraged.  Time to state your preferences..

Write down the letter "s" and then choose one of the following:

  * M ... I am male.

  * F ... I am female.

  * H ... I am a true hermaphoradite.

  * f ... I am a man trapped in a woman's body.

  * N ... None of your f*cking business.

  * P ... Polyamorous (likes relationships with more than one person, with

    little or no contact between partners).

  * S ... Swinger (no serious commitment.. discrete but no commitment at all)

    the choice is made: that's it. It's set in stone.

    can be negotiated from time to time.

  * z ... Some style of relationship which is not listed in the above.

                              Relationship STATUS

Okay, at the risk of making the Goth Code seem like an excuse to post an
abbreviated personal ad at the end of your .Signature (er, well, I suppose it
_is_, but, umm ;-) ), use this code to let people know whether they or their
friends "'ave a chance."

  * Sm ... Married

  * Se ... Engaged

  * Sr ... Involved in a relationship with a primary partner,

  * Ss ... Single or only involved with a secondary partner and available
    (refer to prefered relationship type to indicate what's most likely)

Add to this an additional suffix from the following:

    but, no "wanna fuck?" email thankyou..

  * N ... No, I'm -not- available for a (primary) partnership right now, so
    don't send me wannas.

  * W ... Please send me your personal Ad.

And add to this a final suffix:

  * y ... Yes, I'm available to the right person for something nice 'n' casual
    or one-night-standish.. but, I have high standards, so you may not be the
    one I'll go for.

  * n ... No, I'm not available for a one-night-stand or casual sex.  Get over
    it.

  * w ... Yes, you can send me "wanna fuck?"s if you like..

     (January 1996), my relationship status was: SrNn

                              Your Gothic KINKINESS

In gothic relationships, sexual play can become an issue.  Some people can find

do you stand?

                                  Your LOCATION

So, where are you living?  With the advent of business involvement on the
Internet, with such organisations such as AOL, DIALix, etc, putting huge
volumes of people on the 'net, you can't rely on people to look up the
University in the Commonwealth and United States Yearbooks or other directories
to find out where you are.

So, add your Country domain code to the "L" prefix in _LOWERCASE_ (eg, "au" for
Australia, "us" for the United States [and for politeness sake, please add this
in], "uk" for the United Kingdom) and then your State's general Abbreviation,
as it's most commonly seen or able to be abbreviated.

People in the UK (or other places where there are no standard abbreviations for
their states or territories) might want to abbreviate their locale in some way
that's meaningful to others in your country.

  * au ... Australia

  * ru ... Russian Federation

  * ca ... Canada

  * de ... German

Visit http://nic.merit.edu/nsfnet/statistics/nets.by.country for a more
extensive listing of country domain codes if your country's code doesn't appear
above.

Some examples of what you should have down on your page are as follows: LusWA,
LauVic, LauNSW, LusVA, LukSurr, LukSuff, LukLon, LukNI, LsuChe

Add to this one of the following (or an integer inbetween):

  * 9 ... I live in the inner city.

  * 8 ... I'm 2 km from the city centre.

  * 7 ... I'm 4 km from the city centre.

USENET postings.  It fits in even a small four-line signature, with enough

most eye-readers of v3.0 codes.
