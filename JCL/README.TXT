
JCL-Plasma v1.3a - (C) 1994 JCL-Software
----------------------------------------

This is a routine I've knocked up over the last couple of days to
generate a 'real' plasma effect.  It was inspired by the plasma in
RFVDEMO.ZIP by Thomas Hagen, and seeing his made me want to go write one
of my own.  This one is a little different, however, from the routines
already available (there are a couple of others).  Firstly it runs in
full-screen 320x200 (as opposed to 160x100), and on my 486DX/33 it runs
at _70fps_ both of which are vast improvements over the others that I
have seen.

A 486 is recommended for this code.  It will work on a 386, but its a
bit jerky.  (note that this will NOT work on a 286 - sorry).

I've put all the source code here - feel free to tweak, especially with
the generating functions, but PLEASE distribute this ZIP file intact.
