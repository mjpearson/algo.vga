 This program is used to extract 256 color palette data from PCX-images.
 You can create cool palette with program like Deluxe Paint (DP can't save
 the palette alone), and extract it from .PCX with PCXPAL.
 PCXPAL creates new file, which consists of 768 bytes, which are red, green
 and blue values (0-63) of colors 0-255. Like this:
 RED0,GREEN0,BLUE0,RED1,GREEN1,BLUE1,RED2,GREEN2,BLUE2..RED255,GREEN255,BLUE255
 Now you can use different palettes easily whenever you need them, just great!

 I used about ten minutes to write this program, so don't expect anything
 spectacular.. Now, go and try this program and send me some mail about it.
 I know this program sucks and it's totally useless, so you don't have to tell
 me that :). It sucks mainly because it was written with Pascal. When I learn
 more assembler, I'll rewrite this program and it will be much more smaller
 and faster.
