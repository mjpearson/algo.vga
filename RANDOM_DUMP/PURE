 The words of purification are:

    Asperges me, Therion, hyssopo, et mundabor;
    lavabis me, et super nivem dealbabor.

 Those of consecration are:

    Accendat in nobis Therion ignem sui amoris et flammam aeternae
    caritatis.

These may now advantageously be replaced by (a)

"... pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result,
     is every way perfect."

(CCXX, I, 44) to banish;

and (b)

"... I am uplifted in thine heart; and the kisses of the stars rain hard
     upon thy body."

(CCXX, II, 62) to consecrate.  For the Book of the Law contains the
Supreme Spells.
